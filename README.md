# Amicis Commerce Agents

AI-powered voice and chat agents for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## What is an AI Agent?

Unlike traditional chatbots that only answer questions, an AI agent can actually **take action** on your behalf. Amicis Commerce Agents connect directly to your Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce environment and can:

- 🔍 **Search and retrieve data** — Products, customers, orders, inventory
- ✏️ **Update records** — Tasks, customer notes, client books
- 🤖 **Automate workflows** — Multi-step processes triggered by voice
