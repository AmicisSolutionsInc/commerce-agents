### What's an AI Agent?

Unlike chatbots that just answer questions, an AI agent can actually **do things**:

| | Capability |
|---|------------|
| 🔍 | **Search & retrieve data** — Products, customers, orders, inventory |
| ✏️ | **Update records** — Tasks, customer notes, client books |
| 🤖 | **Automate workflows** — Multi-step processes triggered by voice |

> *Say "find customer Karen Berg" and the agent finds her. Say "show me her purchase history" and it fetches her orders directly from Commerce. No menu navigation. Instant results.*
